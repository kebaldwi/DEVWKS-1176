# DNAC-TEMPLATES [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES)
## Overview

This Repository will give examples of templates used in DNA Center that can be modified. Additional information will be included to hopefully give a well rounded explanation of Automation methods with Templates using DNA Center and flows with both Onboarding and DayN Templates and concepts.

The repository will include scripts and examples with the following:

1. Template Scripting in both
   - Velocity Language
   - Jinja2 Language
2. Variables in both
   - Velocity Language
   - Jinja2 Language
3. Binding Variables
4. System Variables
5. Regular Templates
6. Composite Templates

The goal of this repository is a practical guide to allow engineers to rapidly begin using DNAC automation and begin conversion of IOS CLI Templates. The Templates have been developed over the years and with various use cases in mind, and so the intent of sharing this collection is to reduce the lift to begin automating.

## Intent Based Networking

Either one or multiple Templates may be used to deploy Intent in combination with the Design Settings and Policies deployed within the UI. One or Multiple templates may be used in Onboarding (PnP) or Day N methods. Day N methods are designed for making ongoing changes and may require 'no' statements depending on the configuration construct being modified. 

Additionally:

1.	Intent can be defined as the set of configuration constructs deployed via a template.
2.	Variables can be used to modify or choose between constructs deployed via decision (‘IF’) statements
3.	Repetition of any construct may be introduced through the use of Looping structures on any device.
4.	Variables may be used when the device is being onboarded or provisioned

## [Practical Template Examples](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/ExamplesAndConcepts.md)

In this section I have compiled a number of template examples built with Jinja2 Language. These samples include a wide ranging set of configurations which may be used in your labs to solve specific configuration requirements. This collection summarizes aspects covered previously in this templating repository, and are aimed at providing quick practical references to help engineers solve automation tasks with the help of DNA Center. Additionally these examples may be used in testing in [dCloud](https://dcloud.cisco.com) with any of the labs on this repository.

## DCLOUD as a LAB

### Overview

As a quick start with DNA Center Automation, you may utilize the above labs in conjuction with DCLOUD's sandbox:

1. [Cisco Enterprise Networks Hardware Sandbox West DC](https://dcloud2-sjc.cisco.com/content/catalogue?search=Enterprise%20Networks%20Hardware%20Sandbox&screenCommand=openFilterScreen)
2. [Cisco Enterprise Networks Hardware Sandbox East DC](https://dcloud2-rtp.cisco.com/content/catalogue?search=Enterprise%20Networks%20Hardware%20Sandbox&screenCommand=openFilterScreen)

This allows you to run these labs and gives not only an environment to try the various code samples, but also to develop and export your own code for use in your production environment. DCLOUD  provides for rapid and safe POC/POV on-demand environment without impacting production environments. DCLOUD also negates the need for shipping equipment, associated lead times, and licensing issues associated with setting up your own private testing environment. Please do adhere to the best practices for the DCLOUD environment when using it.

DCLOUD allows for use with a web-based browser client for VPN-less connectivity, as well as AnyConnect VPN client connectivity for those who prefer it. The labs are hosted in Cisco San Jose Facility (Select US East or US West Region when scheduling in DCLOUD). Choose the Cisco Enterprise Network Sandbox version you prefer. 

>**Note:** To access this or any other content, including demonstrations, labs, and training in DCLOUD please work with your Cisco Account team or Cisco Partner Account Team directly. Your Account teams will make sure the session is scheduled and shared for you to use. Once booked follow the guide within Github to complete the tasks adhering to the best practices of the dCLOUD environment.

## Examples

These examples must be used with two conditions:
* Deployed a PnP Discovery method and DHCP scope - see [PnP Workflow](./PnP-Workflow.md#pnp-workflow)
* Build the template with methods detailed - see [Creating Templates](./Templates.md#template-creation)

Specific examples of Templates are available in the following folders:
* [PnP Onboarding](./ONBOARDING) - Examples of PnP/ZTP Templates explained in [Onboarding Templates](./Onboarding.md#onboarding-templates-and-flows)
* [DayN](./DAYN) - Examples of DayN Templates explained in [DayN Templates](./DayN.md#day-n-templates-and-flows)
